## Information 

The first page is the catalogue page. The `cart` button will make the interface go to the cart page.

On the cart page one can go back to the catalogue page.

On the catalogue page there are 6 items that are purchasable. There is also a `reset cart` button that will reset the user's basket. 
One can select `First test Offer` which is loaded by default or use the `second test offer` or `both tests offer`. The bonus question does not work to its full capacity. The beginning of the functionality is there but was not completed due to time.
